## About Me

I am a **Master of Science in Robotics** student with a strong foundation in robotics software development, autonomy, and simulation. I specialize in building reliable and intelligent robotic systems by combining knowledge of control theory, dynamics, kinematics, perception, artifical intelligence, and embedded development. My work spans mulit-agent systems, autonomous navigation, simulation frameworks, machine learning, and hardware-software integration. I am passionate about solving complex real-world problems in robotics through systems-level thinking and rigorous engineering practices.

## 🛠️ Projects

### 1. Autonomous Maze Navigation (Spring 2025)  
Developed a ROS2-based system for navigating a maze with the TurtleBot3 Burger. The project integrates computer vision, LiDAR, odometry, PID control, and SLAM to enable the robot to detect road signs, avoid obstacles, and follow dynamic waypoints. Navigation behaviors were built modularly across packages, combining object tracking, environment mapping, and motion control into a full autonomy stack.

**Keywords:** ROS2, TurtleBot3, SLAM, Computer Vision, LiDAR, PID Control, Autonomous Navigation

### 2. RoboJackets: RoboWrestling Team (Fall 2024 - Spring 2026)  
Contributed to the software stack for autonomous sumo-style robots in Georgia Tech’s RoboJackets team. Developed sensor integration pipelines, opponent detection logic, and real-time decision-making systems using C++ and ROS2. Starting Summer 2025, I will lead the design and build of a personal bot, including mechanical CAD and 3D printing, custom PCB design and wiring, and advanced algorithm development to refine competitive strategy and control.

**Keywords:** C++, Object-Oriented Programming, State Machines, Real-Time Robotics, Embedded Systems, SolidWorks, PCB Design

## 🧪 Lab Work & Research

I currently contribute to the **Robotarium** at Georgia Tech — a lab focused on swarm robotics and multi-agent systems. Below, I outline my ongoing and future work in the Robotarium.

### 1. Robotarium Backend Migration (Spring 2025)  
Migrated the Robotarium backend communication from MQTT to ROS2, improving scalability and compatibility with modern robotics stacks. Developed MATLAB and Python interfaces and built publisher/subscriber and server/client logic to control multiple robots.  
**Keywords:** ROS2, MQTT, MATLAB, Python, Distributed Systems  

### 2. Sensor Integration for New-Generation Robots (Summer 2025)  
Integrating distance and INS sensors into new robot platforms to enhance real-world perception and simulation fidelity. Tasks include:
- Sensor evaluation and physical integration  
- ROS2 driver development and real-time data fusion  
- Simulation model creation mimicking sensor behavior
- Deployment on physcial test-bed robots

**Expected Outcomes:** Accurate sensor-based localization for SLAM/obstacle avoidance and improved simulation-to-reality match.  
**Keywords:** ROS2, Sensor Fusion, Hardware Integration, Simulation Fidelity, Robotics Research  
**GitHub Repo** ➡️ [Coming Soon]

### 3. Capstone: Coordinated Aerial-Ground Path Planning (Fall 2025 – Spring 2026) 
Designing a planning framework for heterogeneous robot teams (drones + ground robots) in the Robotarium. Project components include:
- CBF-enforced safety logic  
- Simulation of joint aerial-ground task execution  
- Real-world deployment on Robotarium ground and aerial agents  

**Tools:** Python, ROS2, Robotarium API, CBFs  
**Keywords:** Path Planning, Multi-Robot Systems, Control Barrier Functions
