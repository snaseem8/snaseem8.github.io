## About Me

I am a **Master of Science in Robotics** student with a strong foundation in robotics software development, autonomy, and simulation. I specialize in building reliable and intelligent robotic systems by combining knowledge of control theory, dynamics, kinematics, perception, artifical intelligence, and embedded development. My work spans mulit-agent systems, autonomous navigation, simulation frameworks, machine learning, and hardware-software integration. I am passionate about solving complex real-world problems in robotics through systems-level thinking and rigorous engineering practices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects

### 1. Autonomous Maze Navigation (Spring 2025)  
Developed a ROS2-based system for navigating a maze with the TurtleBot3 Burger. The project integrates computer vision, LiDAR, odometry, PID control, and SLAM to enable the robot to detect road signs, avoid obstacles, and follow dynamic waypoints. Navigation behaviors were built modularly across packages, combining object tracking, environment mapping, and motion control into a full autonomy stack.

**Keywords:** ROS2, TurtleBot3, SLAM, Computer Vision, LiDAR, PID Control, Autonomous Navigation

### 2. RoboJackets: RoboWrestling Team (Fall 2024 - Spring 2026)  
Contributed to the software stack for a 500g autonomous sumo-style robot in Georgia Tech‚Äôs RoboJackets team. Developed sensor integration pipelines, opponent detection logic, and real-time decision-making systems using C++. Starting Summer 2025, I will contribute to the mechanical and software development of a 500g Remote Controlled robot, including CAD, 3D printing, and advanced algorithm development to refine competitive strategy and control.

## üß™ Lab Work & Research

I currently contribute to the **Robotarium** at Georgia Tech ‚Äî a lab focused on swarm robotics and multi-agent systems. The Robotarium project provides a remotely accessible swarm robotics research platform that remains freely accessible to anyone. Currently, Robotics research requires significant investments in terms of manpower and resources to competitively participate. However, we believe that anyone with new, amazing ideas should be able to see their algorithms deployed on real robots, rather than purely simulated. In order to make this vision a reality, we have created a remote-access, robotics lab where anyone can upload and test their ideas on real robotic hardware. Below, I outline my ongoing and future work in the Robotarium.

### 1. Robotarium Backend Migration (Spring 2025 - Present)  
Migrating the Robotarium backend communication from MQTT to ROS2, improving scalability and compatibility with modern robotics stacks. Developed MATLAB and Python interfaces and built publisher/subscriber and server/client logic to control multiple robots.  
**Keywords:** ROS2, MQTT, MATLAB, Python, Distributed Systems  

### 2. Sensor Integration for New-Generation Robots (Summer 2025 - Present)  
Integrating distance, INS, and encoder sensors into new robot platforms to enhance real-world perception and simulation fidelity. Tasks include:
- Sensor evaluation and physical integration  
- ROS2 driver development and real-time data fusion  
- Simulation model creation mimicking sensor behavior
- Deployment on physcial test-bed robots

**Expected Outcomes:** Accurate sensor-based data for use on a remote-access swarm robotics testbed and improved simulation-to-reality match.  
**Keywords:** ROS2, Sensor Fusion, Hardware Integration, Simulation Fidelity, Robotics Research  

### 3. Capstone: Integrating SLAM with a Remote-Access Swarm Robotics Testbed (Fall 2025 ‚Äì Spring 2026)

Use the newly integrated sensing technology in the Robotarium to enable SLAM-based localization and obstacle mapping. Once validated in a proof-of-concept, extend this functionality across the entire testbed to support all Robotarium users.

**Key Components**
- SLAM implementation for Robotarium agents  
- Integration with CBF-based safety logic for collision avoidance  
- Deployment in Python and MATLAB simulation 
- Real-world deployment on Robotarium ground agents  

**Tools:** Python, ROS2, Robotarium API, SLAM libraries (e.g., GMapping, Cartographer), Control Barrier Functions  
**Keywords:** SLAM, Obstacle Mapping, Multi-Robot Systems, Path Planning, Safety-Critical Control
